This RFP is designed to ensure the project meets all functional and non-functional requirements within the set budget and timelines.

## 2. Project Overview
The Procurement Management System is a web-based application that allows users to add, edit, and delete procurement requests. It integrates features for configuration management and procurement process simulation. The system aims to streamline resource management, optimize costs, and reduce risks associated with procurement delays.

## 3. Project Scope
We are seeking suppliers for the following services and tools to support the development and deployment of this web application:
- **Hosting Service**: To host the application securely with scalability options.
- **Database Service**: To store procurement data, support high availability, and ensure data integrity.
- **Software Development Tools**: For source control, issue tracking, and team collaboration.

## 4. Requirements
### 4.1 Hosting Service Requirements
- Must support hosting for **Flask-based** applications.
- Must offer **SSL encryption** and secure data transmission.
- Must provide **automatic backups** and disaster recovery options.
- Must be capable of handling **scaling** for increased traffic and load.

### 4.2 Database Service Requirements
- **Relational database** support (e.g., **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**).
- High availability and fault tolerance.
- Ability to integrate seamlessly with the Flask application using **SQLAlchemy**.
- Support for **automated backups** and **encryption at rest**.

### 4.3 Development Tools and Software Requirements
- **Version Control**: GitHub or GitLab for version control and repository management.
- **Issue Tracking**: Jira, Trello, or GitHub Projects for task and issue management.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI for automating tests and deployment pipelines.

## 5. Selection Criteria
### 5.1 Cost
Suppliers must provide competitive pricing for the hosting and database services, with clear pricing models (e.g., pay-as-you-go or monthly subscription). Cost considerations should also include software development tool licenses.

### 5.2 Service Quality and Reliability
Preference will be given to suppliers with a proven track record of providing reliable hosting and database services with minimal downtime.

### 5.3 Integration and Support
